Module 9 Challenge

# Description
- This project consisted of three main components. data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

In the data modeling and data engineering sections, I utilized QuickDBD (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to design table structures. This involved establishing relationships between tables using primary, foreign, and composite keys to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, I imported data into the designed tables to conduct my analysis.

The data analysis process involved querying the database to extract specific information and gain insights into various aspects of employee data. For detailed SQL queries and results, refer to the corresponding sections in the provided code.
